Fortress of Necros (English Hack by washbear)
=============================================

Necros Fortress (or "Neclos Fortress") is a turn-based RPG released in
Japan for the PC Engine in 1990 on HuCard. It's based on a line of candy
toys, but don't let that fool you - this game was designed by the company
behind the Far East of Eden and Sakura Wars series.

It's probably most notable for its battle animations, which were very
flashy for the time (epilepsy warning).

The game is divided into seven chapters, each with a different
party of three characters.

The 8 characters available are the Mercenary, Knight, Amazon,
Mage, Elf, Samurai, Berserker, and Dwarf.

All text in the game was converted to English in December 2025.
A full playthrough was undertaken throughout to make sure no context
was missed.

This hack has been tested on real hardware and its tooling is
open source, see:

Character set
-------------

See `reference.txt` for information on the character set.

The game uses a custom 8-bit text encoding composed of Latin
uppercase, digits, punctuation, Hiragana, Katakana, combining
characters, and some control characters that affect things
like scrolling.

This hack was helped by the efforts of the Japanese fan community to
document the game.
