Fortress of Necross (English Translation)
=========================================

Necros Fortress is a turn-based RPG released in Japan for the PC
Engine in 1990 on HuCard. It's based on a line of candy toys, but
don't let that fool you - this game was designed by the company
behind the Far East of Eden and Sakura Wars series.  It's probably
most notable for its battle animations, which were very flashy
for the time.

The game is divided into seven chapters, each with a different
party of three characters.

The 8 characters available are the Mercenary, Knight, Amazon,
Magician, Elf, Samurai, Beserker, and Dwarf.

Character set
-------------

See `reference.txt` for information on the character set.

The game uses a custom 8-bit text encoding composed of Latin
uppercase, digits, punctuation, Hiragana, Katakana, comibining
characters, and some control characters that effect things
like scrolling.
