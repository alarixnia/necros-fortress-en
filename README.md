Fortress of Necros (English Hack)
=================================

Necros Fortress (or "Neclos Fortress")
is a turn-based RPG released in Japan for the PC Engine in 1990 on
HuCard. It's based on a line of candy toys, but don't let that fool
you - this game was designed by the company behind the Far East of Eden
and Sakura Wars series.  It's probably most notable for its battle
animations, which were very flashy for the time.

The game is divided into seven chapters, each with a different
party of three characters.

The 8 characters available are the Mercenary, Knight, Amazon,
Mage, Elf, Samurai, Beserker, and Dwarf.

Character set
-------------

See `reference.txt` for information on the character set.

The game uses a custom 8-bit text encoding composed of Latin
uppercase, digits, punctuation, Hiragana, Katakana, comibining
characters, and some control characters that effect things
like scrolling.
