Walkthrough for Fortress of Necros
==================================

Part 1 - Night Visitor
----------------------

You start in a bar in Rioau village. There's a bard who can be used
to save the game in the bottom right corner.

When you try to leave the bar, you'll trigger an event. After the
event, go to the village chief's house in the north west of the
village. He'll give you 50G and a task. Use the gold to purchase
some herbs at the medicine shop to the south and head to Fipona
Forest to the south. A cutscene will ensue.

When you arrive at Fipona, go to the east and exit. There's a
bridge to the south, but the enemies here are too strong for now.
Save going south for later.

Treasure chest: Sacred salt.

Talk to the women in the westernmost back room of the roadside inn
to trigger an event. After the event, go back to Rioau and fight
a boss battle with a Sabretooth Tiger on the way. After
defeating it, talk to the roadside innkeeper to trigger an event
and you'll now be able to go to Knight's Town.

After triggering the event and talking to the man outside the
roadside inn, a new overworld shortcut to Rioau without going
through the forest will appear.

Talk to the old man behind the Knight's Town inn (in the northwestern
corner of the town square), then you'll be able to go to Mage's
Shrine to the north when you exit the town.

Talk to the Samurai in the innermost room of the Knight's Castle
(far north of Knight's Town) to trigger a small cutscene.

Once you've equipped yourself, travel to Mage's Shrine. Talk to
the Thief inside the shrine to get a Rope.

Treasure Chests
1F: Herb, Chocolate, Mage's Letter
3F: 50G

After obtaining the Mage's Letter from one of the treasure chests
deep in the Mage's Shrine, go back to the roadside inn. Mage will
be added to your party.

After recruiting Mage, go back to Knight's Town and talk to Knight
in the back of the castle to trigger a cutscene and a boss battle.
After the boss battle with the Sabretooth Tiger is over, you'll
obtain a Locket.

At this point you can search the chest in the north-west part of
the knight's castle grounds to get a new weapon for Mercenary.

Head back to Rioau village.

When you arrive in Rioau, go to the Chief's house, and "use" the
locket on him. He'll let you follow him into his fireplace. Talk
to him again and you'll recieve a Vampire Key, which you can use
to access the Vampire base in the far south of Fipona Forest.

You don't need to go into Rioau's well using the rope to clear the
game, but it gives you a useful item. The cross can be used to heal
Sylvia of vampirism and can deal heavy damage against Vampires.

Make sure to equip yourself with healing items before proceeding.

Cross the bridge to head south into deep Fipona Forest. Talk to
the Amazon in the south-western part to add her to your party.

Use the vampire key on a tree in the south east of the forest
(there's an NPC right next to it) and the bridge to the vampire
headquarters will open.

When you enter the vampire HQ, you'll want to search chests on both
sides to find new weapons. Another sabretooth tiger will be blocking
a path on the first floor. After defeating it, head northwest, and
then south once you go through the door.

Treasure Chests
1F: Steel Mace, Wiz Robe

In the south-east, a boss battle against a vampire will take place.
He will drop an ID card.

With the ID card, return back to the staircase and head east this
time. Use the ID card to proceed further into the facility.

In the west part of the facility, there's a final boss battle
against Mecharos. He can paralyze, so it's a good idea to carry
sacred salts. Make sure to save and heal before proceeding.

Part 2 - Betrayal Blues
-----------------------

Part 2 begins inside the Knight's Town castle. Near the starting
area, you can find Dwarf. Talk to him and he'll join your party.
After that, recieve a package from the weapons shop owner and head
to the Demon Forest.

In the south part of Knight's Town, you can find Berserker for a
small funny cutscene, but he won't join your party.

In the south part of Demon Forest, you can find the Elf and recruit
him to your party.

Head northeast through the Demon Forest to find Rio village, which
has a weapon shop.

Treasure chest: 100G

Once you arrive in Rio, purchase the Clothes in the weapons shop,
and make sure you have a rope. Once you're back in the demon forest,
head to the monster outpost in the south.

There is a building to the north of the pass you can enter to obtain
a Hero's Axe from a small boss battle, which you'll need to proceed
further. The Hero's Axe can also be purchased in Rio, so it's not
necessary to go here to clear the game.

Before you can pass the guards to the south, you'll need to use
the Clothes to disguise yourself as a merchant. A NPC in the
north-east part of the pass will tell you to kill Knight in Rio
village to join the Shogun's forces.

Travel south-east to Cid, deliver the parcel to the refuge and
optionally sleep there (for free!) to heal. In the south of Cid is
a well, the old man says it goes to the monsters' HQ but it really
takes you back to Rio. Use it as a shortcut - using the Hero's Axe
is necessary to clear the rocks.

When you enter the Rio bar, there will now be a fake Knight inside.
Talk to him and scare him away. After that, a shifty man
will give you a badge identifying yourself as a member of Shogun's
army. Go back through the well to Cid.

Optionally, at this point you can travel back to the pass and enter
the restricted area. There you'll be offered a boss battle against
a Dragon in exchange for a powerful weapon for Knight.

Since you have the badge, you can now pass east of Cid to the
monsters' headquarters. Make sure to heal up and obtain supplies
before entering the tower. Boss battles against Samurai, Shogun,
and Oniros will ensue.

Treasure Chests
B1: Herb, 150G
1F: Silver Armor

Part 3: Missing Berserker
